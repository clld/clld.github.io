<p class="lead">Helping collect the world's language diversity heritage.</p>

<p>
  This diversity is exemplified by the
  Sino-Tibetan language family on the map below
  (from <a href="http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sino1245.bigmap.html#4/29.00/103.49">Glottolog</a>).

<p>The Cross-Linguistic Linked Data project is developing and curating interoperable data publication structures using Linked Data principles as integration mechanism for distributed resources. </p>

<p>This philosophy allows for</p>

<ul>
<li>small-scale efforts to publish individual databases like <a href="http://wals.info">WALS</a> (World Atlas of Language Structures) or <a href="http://wold.clld.org">WOLD</a> (World Loanword Database), thereby preserving the brands established by these projects, </li>
<li>while at the same time facilitating uniform access to the data across publications.</li>
</ul><p>Within the project, this approach will be applied to publishing lexical and grammatical databases already compiled at the <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de">MPI-EVA</a> and elsewhere. This has led to a <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld">software framework</a> which can then be used to develop database journals, i.e. edited collections of databases submitted by linguists from around the world.</p>

<p>
    A list of databases implemented as <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld">clld</a> applications
    and published on the CLLD platform is available following the <a href="datasets.html">Datasets</a> link.
</p>

<p>The following journals will soon be started for linguistic databases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Journal of Cross-Linguistic Databases (JCLD), edited by Harald Hammarström</li>
<li>Dictionaria (journal of dictionaries of less widely studied languages), edited by Martin Haspelmath &amp; Iren Hartmann</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of linking linguistic data uniquely to languages, language codes are needed for each language and each variety. For this reason, the CLLD project also comprises:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://glottolog.org">Glottolog</a> (catalog of all languages, families and dialects, with comprehensive reference information), edited by Harald Hammarström, Martin Haspelmath &amp; Robert Forkel</li>
</ul>
