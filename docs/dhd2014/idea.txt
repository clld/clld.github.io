clld for data publications:
- provide API (RDF, JSON, ...)
- provide "reference implementation" of a viewer
  -> screenshots dictionaria and apics
- viewers can be developed independently:
  -> screenshots tilemill, rdf-browser
- link to phonotactics, ipython notebook viewer, lens, ...

API will be possible to maintain with low effort!
