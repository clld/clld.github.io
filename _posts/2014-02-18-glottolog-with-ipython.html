    <a href="http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~sbank/">Sebastian Bank</a> from the University of
    Leipzig shared an <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython notebook</a>
    which can serve as a tutorial for
    <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/xflr6/9050337/glottolog.ipynb">Exploring Glottolog with Python</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I think this is a fantastic resource using CLLD data the way it was meant to be used,
    but also showcasing
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        how to efficiently leverage the tools of the
        <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Python eco-system for scientific computing</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
        how to cope with data expressed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>
        &ndash; a data model more expressive but also more complicated than the typical
        arrangement of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_%28information%29">data in tables</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
        how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducible research</a>
        could look like.</li>
</ul>
