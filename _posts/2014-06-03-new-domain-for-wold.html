title: New domain for the World Loanword Database

<p>
    For a project setting out to publish Linked Data on the web this is close to the
    worst case scenario, but
    for reasons beyond our control we have to serve the <i>World Loanword Database</i>
    under a new domain.
    Starting June 3, 2014 <i>WOLD</i> should be accessed using the domain
    <a href="http://wold.clld.org">wold.clld.org</a>
    instead of the old domain <i>wold.livingsources.org</i>.
</p>

<p>
    So all identifiers minted for resources within <i>WOLD</i> will become invalid,
    although in a way which makes them rather easy to fix.
    Until the end of 2014 the old domain will be redirected to the new one, but
    make sure you update bookmarks or links accordingly.
    From January 2015
    <i>wold.livingsources.org</i> is no longer under our control.
    Unfortunately at that point it will not be possible anymore to alert visitors to
    <i>wold.livingsources.org</i> to this change.
</p>
<p>
    We regret that we could not find a better solution, apologize for
    the inconvenience and promise to do better with <i>clld.org</i>.
