    A <a href="/docs/dhd2014/poster_a4.pdf">poster presenting the CLLD project</a> was accepted at
    <a href="http://www.dhd2014.uni-passau.de/">DHd 2014</a> - the first conference
    of the association "Digital Humanities im deutschsprachigen Raum" - to be held in
    Passau from March 26 to March 28.

    While digital humanities is a large field still in search of a clear definition
    (which is part of the raison d'Ãªtre of this conference), it will be interesting to
    find out how the CLLD project fits together with similar efforts at the intersection
    of humanities, data and publishing.
