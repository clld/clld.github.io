    With people in
    <a href="http://www.spw.uzh.ch/moran.html">Zurich</a> and
    <a href="http://haraldhammarstrom.ruhosting.nl/">Nijmegen</a> having installed the
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> framework successfully (and on
    <a href="http://clld.readthedocs.org/en/latest/macosx.html">different</a>
    <a href="http://clld.readthedocs.org/en/latest/windows.html">platforms</a>, no less),
    it was time to make a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Python package, i.e.
    publish <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> on
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/">the Python Package Index</a>. So here it is:
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clld">clld on PyPI</a>.
    This means that you can now install <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span>
    simply running
    <pre>pip install clld</pre>
</p>

<p>
    This release emphasizes
    <a href="/datasets.html">the third way to publish datasets</a>
    with the help of the CLLD project. Thus, we took some steps to strip the software
    of any relics of our particular use case &ndash; publishing databases at
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld.org</span>.
    If there is demand we might go a step further, making portability to platforms other
    than our
    <a href="http://clld.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#design">target platform</a>
    a goal for the project.
