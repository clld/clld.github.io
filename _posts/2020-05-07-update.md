With `clld` 7.1 out of the door 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3816410.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3816410)
it's time for an update on CLLD-related activities.


Some of CLLD's "flagship" databases have seen some activity recently:


## Glottolog

[Glottolog](https://glottolog.org) is at release 4.2.1 meanwhile, and finally
on a roughly biannual [release schedule](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog/releases).
This is particularly important, because frequent releases will allow faster
addition of new data (e.g. to flesh out the dialect inventory) and
correction of errors, thus make collaboration a lot less frustrating.

While frequent releases also mean that the amount of changes per update will be 
somewhat smaller than with less frequent releases, it may also mean that it
is more often necessary to inspect changes between releases. With Glottolog releases 
at least twice a year, many research projects, papers or datasets will have to cope 
with a version upgrade of Glottolog within their "lifetime". And while it is always
an option to stick with an [older release](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596479) - these 
are long-term archived and available thanks to Zenodo after all - upgrading to the 
latest Glottolog version may help making research more relevant.

Thus, being able to inspect the changes between Glottolog releases easily has become more important. Now, for the sake of the editors' sanity alone, we curate the Glottolog
data in a version controlled repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog).
So going back in time is always possible. And it's even possible to inspect changes
between Glottolog releases "through the web" - e.g. here is a link to the changes
from [release 4.1 to 4.2.1](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog/compare/v4.1...v4.2.1).
But "Files changed âˆž" doesn't sound easily penetrable.

But starting with Glottolog 4.0, each release of Glottolog is supplemented with a
release of Glottolog's core language data as [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org) dataset.
These [releases](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog-cldf/releases) contain a lot
less files and have a far simpler data structure, so inspecting changes becomes easier.
E.g. when inspecting the changes [from 4.1 to 4.2.1](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog-cldf/compare/v4.1...v4.2.1) again, we see (when expanding the diff for `cldf/languages.csv`) that for example
- languoid [sanm1288](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sanm1288) was added, and
- languoid [chiq1248](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/chiq1248) got a new
  name and new geo-location.

Thanks to the design of CLDF datasets, they are easy to inspect using simple
tools, and a ["recipe" in the Glottolog cookbook](https://github.com/glottolog/cookbook/blob/master/recipes/changes.md)
shows how to extract sets of changes between Glottolog releases which are
amenable to human inspection.


## WALS Online

The oldest CLLD database - [WALS Online](https://wals.info) - has seen some activity, too, and again due to CLDF and the way it simplifies data curation.

When conceived, in 2008, WALS Online - the web application - was supposed to be the
authoritative source of WALS data, i.e. any data access should go through the application. With the release of the 2011 edition, with more and updated data,
this became more complicated. While the underlying database was powerful enough to
deal with versioned data *within the database*, making these changes transparent and
accessible for web site visitors was difficult. The 2013 edition didn't exacerbate the
problem, but there was still no satisfying solution.

With CLDF, we finally had a tool to separate data curation from data presentation.
Thus, we built [CLDF datasets for all editions of WALS Online](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/releases) and
[released them on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3606197).
Changes between these editions can be inspected as described above for Glottolog, or
as shown [on the WALS web site](https://wals.info/changes).

We also went one step further: The [WALS CLDF repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals) is now **the** place where WALS data is curated. I.e. errata can
be posted using [issues](https://github.com/cldf-datasets/wals/issues) and the WALS Online
web application is "merely" a place to window-shop the current edition. Actual access to
and re-use of the data should go through the released CLDF datasets from Zenodo.

Since the CLDF format is well specified, we hope that more people than before will
be able to re-use the data - possibly even sharing [tools and recipes](https://github.com/cldf/cookbook/blob/master/README.md).
In fact, we hope that the accessibility of CLDF will make up for the loss of the
myriad of download formats we had for WALS before. As an example, we put together
a description of [how to create the "WALS feature matrix"](https://github.com/cldf/cookbook/tree/master/recipes/long_to_wide) from the CLDF data.
If this description looks a bit messy, that's partly because it describes 
["un-tidy-ing" data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#tidy-data-1) - which we
don't want to encourage :)


## clld 7.0 with better support for CLDF

Finally, the [`clld` toolkit](https://github.com/clld/clld) - which powers all CLLD web applications - also received updates embracing CLDF as the new standard
for data curation.

This should not be very surprising, considering the history of CLDF (and the CLLD project). In 2014 we described `clld` as an attempt at ["standardizing the Microsoft way"](/docs/reflex/clld.pdf) - i.e. data access can be standardized across datasets
when this access is mediated through the same software stack (just like Word documents were supposed to work everywhere - provided you open them with the Word program). But it was clear
from the beginning, that this is not really sustainable (not even when you are Microsoft) - in particular since it required
people to run `clld` apps to share their data in a standard way.
But `clld` helped us understand our data better and thus led to the specification of
CLDF - which can be seen as a specification of a serialization of the data model of `clld` applications.

So with CLDF available, we could turn our data curation and publication workflows around:
The primary data sources are now (versioned and published) CLDF datasets, while `clld`
apps - as described for WALS above - are relegated to marketing tools. This allowed us
to simplify the `clld` toolkit, e.g. removing support for in-database versioning.
But on the other hand functionality was needed to simplify loading a CLDF dataset into
a `clld` app.

Such functionality has now been released with `clld` 7.1. So, serving John Peterson's
dataset
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3603755.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3603755) from a `clld` application is as simple as running a
couple of commands:

1. [Install `clld`](https://clld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#requirements):
   ```
   pip install clld==7.1
   ```

2. Create a project template suited to a [CLDF StructureDataset](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/modules/StructureDataset)
   ```shell script
   clld create -f peterson/ cldf_module=structuredataset --quiet
   ```

3. Install the (newly created) application:
   ```
   cd peterson
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Load the data into the application's database:
   ```shell script
   clld initdb development.ini --cldf PATH/TO/cldf/petersonsouthasia/cldf/StructureDataset-metadata.json  --glottolog PATH/TO/glottolog/glottolog
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```shell script
   pserve development.ini
   ```

The app can then be visited locally at http://localhost:6543/ and by default supports e.g.
- languages color-coded by family:

- feature values color-coded by value:
