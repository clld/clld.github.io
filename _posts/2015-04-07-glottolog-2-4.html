<p>
    Two weeks ago we released
    <a href="http://glottolog.org">version 2.4 of Glottolog</a>
    - our comprehensive language catalog and bibliography. This update includes
    <a href="http://glottolog.org/news">
    the addition of 76 languages resulting in moderate corrections of the classification
    </a>,
    as well as two changes which are worth highlighting:
    <strong>68131 new references</strong> and a new collaborative curation model.
</p>


<h3>68131 new references</h3>
<p>
    The first results of our
    <a href="http://www.degruyter.com/dg/newsitem/126/die-maxplanckgesellschaft-und-de-gruyter-kooperieren-der-verlag-stellt-bibliografische-daten-fr-die-open-access-datenbank-glottolog-zu-verfgung">
        agreement with publisher De Gruyter
    </a>
    are 68131 new references, representing
    <a href="http://glottolog.org/providers/degruyter">
        about 3900 books and 4900 journal issues on language and linguistics published by De Gruyter.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    While a lot of these references are somewhat different from the typically descriptive
    works collected so far in Glottolog and most of them cannot readily be associated with
    any language, we still think this is an important step towards fulfilling Glottolog's
    claim of comprehensiveness.
</p>

<h3>Glottolog data on GitHub</h3>
<p>
    The second big step we took with Glottolog 2.4 is a new way of data curation.
    So far, feedback about and collaboration on the Glottolog data has been almost exclusively
    restricted to sending emails to the editors. As of version 2.4, the Glottolog data is
    curated in
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data">
        a Git repository on GitHub.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    This means, that work on Glottolog becomes a lot more transparent - in particular in between
    releases; and even more importantly the big catalyst for collaboration that is GitHub
    can be harnessed for work on Glottolog:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Notify us about issues with the data by - well -
        <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data/issues">
            opening an issue.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Track changes of the data by following
        <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data/commits/master">
        our commits.
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Curate your own version of data by
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">
        forking the repository
        </a>
        or - better yet - </li>
    <li>send us a
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">
        pull request,
        </a>
        thereby contributing your additions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Glottolog data elsewhere</h3>
<p>
    With
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data" style="font-family: monospace">clld/glottolog-data</a>
    the authoritative raw source of the data and
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data" style="font-family: monospace">glottolog.org</a>
    the authoritative access point to releases of this repository,
    there are still more ways to get at Glottolog data, recognizing the different
    requirements of our users:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://datahub.io/dataset/clld-glottolog">
        Glottolog 2.4 on datahub.io</a></dt>
    <dl>To make Glottolog part of the
        <a href="http://linguistic-lod.org/llod-cloud">
            Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud
        </a>
        we provide an RDF dump of the data at datahub.io.
    </dl>
    <dt>
        <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/16245">
        Glottolog 2.4 on zenodo</a></dt>
    <dl>
        If you need a stable snapshot of version 2.4 of the Glottolog data with a citeable DOI,
        this is the place to go.
    </dl>
    <dt>
        <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/16246">
        glottolog3 version 2.4 on zenodo</a></dt>
    <dl>
        And if you want to revive this snapshot of the data, make sure you grab the
        corresponding app source code from here.</dl>
