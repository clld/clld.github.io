As it turns out, our predictions for 
[main work packages in 2014](http://clld.org/2014/01/03/new-year.html) have been rather inaccurate, to say the least.

Instead, among the big themes of last year we find outreach and exploring collaborative data curation.

### Outreach


After exploring how CLLD might fit into the Digital Humanities in
[Passau](http://clld.org/2014/03/24/clld-at-dhd2014.html),
I was off to 
[LREC in Reykjav√≠k](http://clld.org/2014/04/04/clld-at-ldl2014.html)
to talk about the *LD* in *CLLD* at the [3rd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics](http://ldl2014.org/index.html).
I also registered for the workshop on 
[Collaboration and Computing for Under-Resourced Languages in the Linked Open Data Era](http://www.ilc.cnr.it/ccurl2014/)
which seemed to have been a good fit for a talk on CLLD as well; So this might be a direction to
explore in the two years to come.

The highlight of the year was a more focussed workshop, though, the workshop on
[Language Comparison with Linguistic Databases (LanCLiD)](http://clld.org/2014/10/10/reflex-workshop.html).
With a [successor workshop in Leipzig next year](http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/conferences/2014-ws-lanclid2/)
and a [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cross-linguistic-databases) on the
web, we hope to establish a group of interested researchers coherent enough to work on topics like
interoperability of resources.


### Collaborative data curation

A question that comes up about [WALS Online](http://wals.info) every once in a while is how to
contribute to the database. We do not really have a good answer to that by now (although the
upcoming Journal of Cross-Linguistic Databases may turn out to be the answer).
[Tsammalex](http://tsammalex.clld.org) a database we published as beta version this year
shows - at least technically - an interesting alternative: Bringing the collaboration
model of the open source software world to research data. We'll explain what *fork*, *release* and
*pull request* mean in this context in a separate post soon.

Of course we have not been the only or first ones to harness GitHub for data curation.
The curators of the [PHOIBLE database](http://phoible.org) have been [doing this](https://github.com/phoible/phoible) 
for some time now. Which brings us to the next topic:


### New databases

The first new database published in 2014 was [SAILS](http://sails.clld.org), a typological
database on languages of South America (see also the [release notes](http://clld.org/2014/04/04/new-dataset-sails.html)). 
Later in the year we finally published
[PHOIBLE](http://phoible.org), the world's largest collection of phoneme inventories
(see also the [release notes](http://clld.org/2014/09/15/phoible-online.html)).

So while we did work on lexical datasets in 2014, we did not publish any. Fortunately this
changed earlier this week, when the [ASJP dataset](http://asjp.clld.org) was finally published
within the CLLD framework;
and then there is the "open beta" version of
[Tsammalex](http://tsammalex.clld.org), a
multilingual lexical database on plants and animals including an image repository. Over the
next months we plan to expand the coverage substantially and hope to make this a cross-disciplinary useful
resource.


### 2015

The good thing about the failed predictions for 2014: They can be recycled and make good predictions for 2015!
