On April 30, just before the big 
[closing conference of the Department of Linguistics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/conferences/diversity-linguistics-retrospect-and-prospect/home.html)
we hosted the second of what we hope to become a series of workshops on
[Language Comparison with Linguistic Databases](http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/conferences/2014-ws-lanclid2/index.html).

[The presentations](https://github.com/clld/lanclid2) nicely clustered into two thematic categories:

1. Visualization of linguistic data.
2. Best practices in database publishing.

In one of the talks in the latter category, Harald Hammarstr√∂m presented a proposal for an exchange format
for cross-linguistic data **cldf**, which then provided ample opportunity for discussion, which we hope
to continue on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cross-linguistic-databases)
and [the **cldf** repository on GitHub](https://github.com/glottobank/cldf/).

Although the talks of the morning session provided a good backdrop for discussions about what
kind of data we want to exchange and what kind of tools we may want to exchange it with, it
turned out that a lack of clear use cases will impede the development of a format like **cldf**.
So the next weeks will hopefully see some clearer descriptions of such use cases.

In any case, a workshop series like LanCLiD provides the perfect scaffolding for a
working group dedicated to standardisation of cross-linguistic data.
