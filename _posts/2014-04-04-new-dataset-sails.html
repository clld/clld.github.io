    Yesterday we published the
    <a href="http://sails.clld.org">South American Indigenous Language Structures (SAILS) Online</a>
    - a large database of grammatical properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials
    (such as reference grammars) by a team from the
    <a href="http://www.ru.nl/linc/">Languages in Contact Group (LinC) at Radboud University Nijmegen</a>
    directed by
    <a href="http://www.ru.nl/multilingualism/people/pieter-muysken/">Pieter Muysken</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We are particularly happy because
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/sails">the web application</a>
    - based on the
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld"><span style="font-family: monospace">clld</span> framework</a>
    - was programmed by Harald Hammarstr√∂m, thus providing evidence that our software is indeed
    re-usable. Should you encounter any problems using SAILS Online, feel free to open an
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/sails/issues">issue at GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Like all apps built on <span style="font-family: monospace">clld</span>, SAILS Online implements the
    <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/openarchivesprotocol.htm">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</a>
    as required for <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/archives">archives to be indexed by OLAC</a>.
    So as soon as OLAC has harvested the SAILS metadata, you will SAILS language resource when
    searching OLAC.
