    After the first of four years of funding it is time to review what has been
    achieved in 2013 and to outline the next milestones of the project.
</p>

<h3>Setting up project infrastructure</h3>
<p>
    Since software is an important result of the project, we had to look for a way to host
    code repositories. But for a project that wants to reach out to the wider linguist and
    developer communities, we actually didn't have to look hard. If lowering barriers for
    contribution and collaboration is a goal, there's no way around GitHub.
</p>
<p>
    So we set up an <a href="https://github.com/clld">organization on GitHub</a>.
    For each database which joins the project we create two repositories, one for the
    software serving the database, and one for the data.
</p>
<p>
    Hosting these repositories on GitHub does also provide us with issue tracking, which
    again is split into one issue tracker for the software of a database (classical bug
    tracking), and one for issues with the data (comparable to errata).
</p>
<p>
    All our web applications are prepared for easy, automatic deployment to a rather
    generic target platform. In particular, it must be possible to deploy an application
    serving one of our databases on a new virtual machine in the
    <a href="http://www.gwdg.de/index.php?id=virtuelle_server">VMWare cluster of the GWDG</a>
    running a single command.
</p>

<h3>The first datasets</h3>
<p>
    Just in time for
    <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_ALT10/">ALT 10</a> we managed
    to get the first two databases published with the new
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld"><span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> framework</a>:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://apics-online.info">APiCS Online</a>
        &ndash; the Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures Online.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        While rather similar to <em>WALS Online</em> - one of the databases that served as prototypes
        for what should be possible with a cross-linguistic database framework - some peculiarities
        have been introduced with <em>APiCS</em>, most notably multiple values for one language/parameter
        pair, thus the notion of a <em>value set</em>, as collection of these values.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://glottolog.org">Glottolog</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Glottolog was the first legacy database re-implemented as CLLD application. Glottolog
        is not really a typological database, but the abstractions of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> framework
        turned out to be flexible enough to model the Glottolog data as well.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Triggered by Google ending the support of its maps API version 2 in November 2013, we had to migrate
    three already published databases to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> framework:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://ewave-atlas.org/">eWAVE</a>
        &ndash; the electronic World Atlas of Varieties of English
    </dt>
    <dd>
        did not pose any particular problems, since its data model is a simplification of
        the ones of WALS and APiCS.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://wals.info/">WALS Online</a>
        &ndash; the World Atlas of Language Structures Online.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Being re-implemented for the second time, the WALS data and functionality was
        well known - but at the same time rather extensive. So we ended up implementing
        more "convenience" functionality than intended, in particular bringing back the
        functionality to
        <a href="http://wals.info/combinations/5A_2A#2/19.5/152.8">compose multiple features</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://wold.clld.org/">WOLD</a>
        &ndash; the World Loanword Database
    </dt>
    <dd>
        played the same role WALS did for typological database in the area of lexicographical
        databases; i.e. it served as a prototype for the data model and functionality of
        a cross-linguistic lexicographical database framework. So porting it to the
        <span style="font-family: monospace;">clld</span> framework went as planned.
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    The last database published within the project in 2013 was
    <a href="http://afbo.info">AfBo: A world-wide survey of affix borrowing</a> - a rather small
    database which still did pose some data modelling problems, because its main research
    objects are language pairs rather than single languages.
</p>


<h3>2014</h3>
<p>
    One focus in 2014 will be on databases with lexicographical data. Migrating
    <a href="http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/ids/">The Intercontinental Dictionary Series</a> and
    the database of
    <a href="http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/ASJPHomePage.htm">ASJP (the Automated Similarity Judgement Program)</a>
    is already underway.
</p>
<p>
    Another main topic are the database journals to be started in 2014. For both, the
    typological database journal JCLD (Journal of cross-linguistic databases) as well as
    the dictionary journal, we are in the process of collecting suitable initial or seed
    publications.
</p>
<p>
    The third workpackage we will tackle in 2014 is a CLLD portal, i.e. a place where you can
    find data/resources across all CLLD datasets.
