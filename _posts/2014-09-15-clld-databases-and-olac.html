    Checking the success of the
    <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/metrics/phoible.org">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        newest CLLD archive registration
    </a>
    with
    <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/index.html">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        OLAC (the Open Language Archives Community)
    </a>
    I thought it was time for some bragging.
</p>

<p>
    OLAC uses the
    <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        OAI-PMH protocol
    </a>
    to harvest metadata for language resources from participating archives.
    Since each application built with the
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        clld framework
    </a>
    comes with an
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld/blob/master/clld/web/views/olac.py">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        implementation of the data provider side
    </a>
    of this protocol, registration of a new archive is simple. By default,
    the details pages of each language identified with an ISO 639-3 code will be
    disseminated as language resources.
</p>
<p>
    Now on to the bragging: As can be seen on
    <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/metrics/">
        <i class="icon-share"> </i>
        OLAC's archive metrics page
    </a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Three repositories in the top-ten of archives ordered by most distinct languages
        (including the number one,
        <a href="http://glottolog.org"><i class="icon-share"> </i>Glottolog</a>)
        are <a href="/datasets.html">CLLD databases</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        When ranked by metadata quality, 7 out of 20 5-star archives are CLLD databases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It has to be noted, though, that OLAC only indexes resources for languages identified
    by ISO 639-3 codes; thus it's difficult to register the resources provided by
    <a href="http://apics-online.info"><i class="icon-share"> </i>APiCS Online</a> or
    <a href="http://ewave-atlas.org"><i class="icon-share"> </i>eWAVE</a>. Hopefully
    someday it will be possible to also register resources tagged with a Glottocode
    (Glottolog's languoid identifier).
