    I spent the last couple of days in Nijmegen having had the fortune of being invited
    to the workshop
    <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/events/language-comparison-with-linguistic-databases-reflex-and-typological-databases/program-abstracts">
        Language Comparison with Linguistic Databases: RefLex and Typological Databases
    </a>
    at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.
</p>


<p>
    <a href="/docs/reflex/clld.pdf">Our presentation</a>
    of the
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/clld">
        <span style="font-family: monospace">clld</span> software
    </a>
    seems to have touched on one issue in particular that is of general interest in the community:
</p>
<blockquote>
    What should be the next step after the "gold rush" of linguistic database creation?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Obviously looking beyond one's own nose was a very good start.
</p>
<p>
    Recurring topics were the importance of appropriate data visualization, and
    the realization that accessing data from tools should be mediated via a (standard) API.
    While automatic creation of an
    <a href="http://portal.clld.org/crossgram">index of language features</a>
    available in different databases may already be a good application exploiting such an API,
    I would guess that a visualization like the
    <a href="http://th-mayer.de/wals/">WALS Sunburst Explorer</a>
    has way more potential to be the killer app to help develop this API.
</p>
<p>
    So as a starting point towards such an API, we will experiment with turning the Sunburst
    Explorer into a visualization app that can suck in data via
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>
    from as many typological databases
    as possible. And we would be happy if you joined the party by joining the list
