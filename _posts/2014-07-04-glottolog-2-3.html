<p>
    Last week has seen updates for two of our flagship datasets:
    <a href="http://glottolog.org">Glottolog</a> (our comprehensive language catalog and bibliography)
    and
    <a href="http://wals.info">WALS Online</a> (the World Atlas of Language Structures Online).
</p>


<h3>Glottolog 2.3</h3>
<p>
    While we would like to stick to a quarterly update schedule for Glottolog, last week's
    update was in fact the first one in 2014. Thus it incorporated quite a few corrections
    proposed to the editors over the last months.
    An overview of the changes is given in Glottolog's new
    <a href="http://glottolog.org/news">News section</a>.
    We also included bibliographical records for
    <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_requests.asp">ISO 639-3 change requests</a>
    as
    <a href="http://glottolog.org/langdoc">references in Glottolog</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the updated dataset, this Glottolog release includes some new functionality.

<dl>
    <dt>New tree view</dt>
    <dd>
        The old visualization of a languoids classification was difficult to navigate; in
        particular it was not possible to compare a given languoid to others in different
        branches of the same family tree.
        This problem has been addressed by a new tree view (see for example the page for the
        language
        <a href="http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/abur1243">Abure</a>).
    </dd>
    <dt>Flexible language maps</dt>
    <dd>
        It is now possible to display the languages from the
        <a href="http://glottolog.org/glottolog/language">language index</a>
        on map, respecting any filter criteria currently applied to the table.
        To do so, click the download button <span class="icon-download-alt"> </span> on top of the table
        and select the format <em>map.html</em>.
        E.g.
        <a href="http://glottolog.org/glottolog/language.map.html?type=languages&sSearch_6=10..20&sSearch_7=10..30">this map</a>
        shows all languages in an area of the world bounded by the geographical latitudes 10째 to 20째 and
        longitudes 10째 to 30째.
    </dd>
    <dt>Country maps:</dt>
    <dd>
        A special case of the language maps are maps for languages spoken in a particular
        country. To display such a map, select a country from the
        <a href="http://glottolog.org/glottolog">languoid search form</a> and hit <em>submit</em>.
        As an example
        <a href="http://glottolog.org/glottolog/language.map.html?country=PG">this map</a>
        shows all languages spoken in Papua New Guinea.
    </dd>

<h3>WALS Online</h3>
<p>
    Compared to the changes in Glottolog, the update of WALS was rather minor. For a list
    of changes, see the corresponding
    <a href="https://github.com/clld/wals-data/issues?labels=wals-2014-7">issues on GitHub</a>.
    Following our distinction between WALS core data and auxiliary data, changes in datapoints
    (i.e. in the coding of languages for features) are traceable from the datapoint pages
    (e.g. <a href="http://wals.info/valuesets/138A-lat">Datapoint Latvian / Tea</a>), while
    for information like language classification we only display the current state.
