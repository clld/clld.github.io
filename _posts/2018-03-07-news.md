title: What's up with CLLD?

While this blog has been quiet for some time, this does not mean there is nothing
to report. In fact, there has been a lot of activity, ranging from major updates
of our servers and our core libraries (e.g. the [`clld` package](https://github.com/clld/clld)), to updates of several CLLD databases and work on new standards.


## CLDF

One of the main results of the CLLD project was establishing a data model that is
capable of capturing most of the cross-linguistic datasets out there. So far this
data model was internal to the [`clld` package](https://github.com/clld/clld). This
can be thought of as the "Microsoft approach to standardization" - if everyone is
using the same software, things are interoperable.

With the [CLDF](http://cldf.clld.org) initiative, we are taking the next step:
By making the data model explicit and well specified, more software can be built
around it. Since the set of all CLLD databases can be taken as proof-of-concept
for the comprehensiveness and flexibility of the data model, we are quite
optimistic that the CLDF standard is flexible enough to describe most datasets
and at the same time concrete enough to allow useful functionality to be built on 
top.


## Glottolog 3.2

One of the CLLD flagships - [Glottolog](http://glottolog.org) - is happily chugging
along; actually, at version 3.2 now, we are close to speeding up to our plan of
multiple releases per year.


## Concepticon 1.1

After collecting many more concept lists over a period of almost 2 years, version 
1.1 of another reference catalog - [Concepticon](http://concepticon.clld.org) - 
has just been released. With almost 100 more concept lists in the 
[pipeline](https://github.com/clld/concepticon-data/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+concept+list%22), we expect to switch to more frequent releases
for Concepticon as well.


## APiCS Online

The [Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures Online](http://apics-online.info) now includes the full chapters of the [printed Atlas](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-atlas-of-pidgin-and-creole-language-structures-9780199691395?cc=de&lang=en&) as well as the [survey chapters](http://apics-online.info/surveys), previously only available in the three
[printed Volumes](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-survey-of-pidgin-and-creole-languages-9780199691401?lang=en&cc=de).


## ASJP version 18

Amazingly - considering the already huge coverage in terms of languages of the 
world - [the ASJP Database](http://asjp.clld.org) managed to integrate another
430 wordlists. As of yesterday, ASJP 18 is out with now 7,655 wordlists.
