    A <a href="/docs/ldl2014/main.pdf">paper describing the CLLD project</a> and the role
    <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a>
    plays in our publishing strategy was accepted at the
    <a href="http://ldl2014.org/index.html">3rd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2014)</a>
    - co-located with <a href="http://lrec2014.lrec-conf.org/en/">LREC 2014</a> - to be held in
    Reykjavik, Iceland on May 27.
</p>
<p>
    I'll be in Reykjavik from May 26 to May 29, attending the
    <a href="http://www.ilc.cnr.it/ccurl2014/">Workshop on "Collaboration and Computing for Under-Resourced Languages in the Linked Data Era"</a>
    as well. So if you happen to be around and
    <ul>
        <li>have cross-linguistic databases which should be published or</li>
        <li>need cross-linguistic datasets to answer research questions</li>
    </ul>
    feel free to get in <a href="/contact.html">contact</a>.
