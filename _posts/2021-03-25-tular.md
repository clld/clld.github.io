title: A new kind of clld app

We recently published [TuLar](https://tular.clld.org) - the Tup√≠an Language Resources site - and the
[Hindu Kush Areal Typology](https://hindukush.clld.org/) site. Both are examples
of a new kind of clld app - one that aggregates different kinds of linguistic
data with an areal focus, rather than collecting data of the same kind (e.g. typological questionnaires) globally. While this kind of customization was
always possible within the [clld framework](https://github.com/clld/clld),
it can now be done more efficiently and in a more principled way. In the
following we describe how.

Both sites/projects follow a new data publication paradigm: The web application
now "merely" serves as browsable, human user interface to the data - allowing
users to "window shop". The actual, citable data underlying the apps is now
one (or multiple) CLDF datasets, archived with and longterm-accessible via DOI
from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). This separation of concerns relieves the web
app from being the single-point-of-failure when it comes to data accessibility.
At the same time, uniformity of data access - across many datasets - is
actually improved thanks to the [CLDF specification](https://cldf.clld.org).

The [Hindu Kush Areal Typology dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4534221)
bundles two CLDF datasets in one record on Zenodo - curated following the
usage example in the [cldfbench paper by List and Forkel](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3231858_1/component/file_3231859/content).

TuLaR goes one step further and aggregates data from multiple Zenodo records.
This can be done transparently by bundling the relevant datasets in a dedicated
[Zenodo community `tular`](https://zenodo.org/communities/tular/), and
querying Zenodo's [OAI-PMH interface](https://developers.zenodo.org/#oai-pmh).
To make this easier, we use our own [zenodoclient](https://pypi.org/project/zenodoclient/) package. The short code snippet below will
- query all datasets in the TuLaR community
- sort them by version number
- print the latest version for each dataset:

```python
from zenodoclient.oai import Records

for (org, repos), recs in itertools.groupby(
    sorted(
        oai.Records('tular'),
        key=lambda r: (r.repos.org, r.repos.repos, r.version),
        reverse=True),
    lambda r: (r.repos.org, r.repos.repos),
):
    if org == 'tupian-language-resources':
        print(r.repos.repos, r.tag)
```

Both apps profit from the CLDF specification because it minimizes the amount of
code necessary to ingest the data into the app's database.

In conclusion, not only does this new data publication paradigm relieve the web
app from duties it was badly positioned to fulfill, but it also allows the app
to take on a new role: It can function much like an [overlay journal](https://www.nature.com/news/leading-mathematician-launches-arxiv-overlay-journal-1.18351),
adding a layer of quality control, or serving as a filter on top of the
ever-growing universe of CLDF datasets.
