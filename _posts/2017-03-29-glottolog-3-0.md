We are happy to announce the release of [Glottolog 3.0](http://glottolog.org).
This is the first release of Glottolog completely based on data curated in the
public GitHub repository [clld/glottolog](https://github.com/clld/glottolog).

## The data repository

At last year's workshop "A new era for cross-linguistic databases" at the Poznan Linguistics Meeting we [presented](/docs/poznan/glottolog-3-0.pdf)
the data curation model now used for Glottolog. This means
- Glottolog data is curated transparently and publicly
- including a full history of changes.
- Community participation is now possible (and welcome!) via GitHub's 
  support for collaboration ([by opening issues](https://github.com/clld/glottolog/issues) or proposing changes via 
  [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
- Accessing the data is now possible directly by cloning the data repository or [downloading of a release](https://github.com/clld/glottolog/releases).
- The data in the repository can also be accessed programmatically using the
  Python client library [`pyglottolog`](https://github.com/clld/glottolog#the-python-client-library-pyglottolog).

Release 3.0 of the data repository is available at 
https://github.com/clld/glottolog/releases/tag/v3.0


## The Glottolog web application

We also introduced a couple of new features for the Glottolog web application:
- Glottolog now has [a logo](http://glottolog.org/static/glottolog_logo.png) - the Malayalam letter ga, Unicode U+0D17.
- You can search for references with a query that will be matched with content in any field of the bibliographical record.
- Languoid detail pages now provide a link to the underlying data file in the data repository (marked with <i class="icon-pencil">).

Release 3.0 of the Glottolog web application is available at
https://github.com/clld/glottolog3/releases/tag/v3.0
